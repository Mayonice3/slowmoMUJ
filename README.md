This is a Project which takes in a sample video in your root folder titled "test_video" and then extracts the frames from it into PNGS.
Then runs a function to generate the Frames in between all frames, effectively doubling the framerate.
After which, the next function stitches all the frames back together into an mp4 that plays at the original framerate, causing a slow 
motion effect.
